# Automated A11y Testing with Cypress

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Running the end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e --watch` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

## Running the app

Run `ng serve`.

## Try it out: Add cypress-axe and fix the a11y errors

Check out the `try-it-yourself` branch, which has the code in a broken state.
Install `cypress-axe`, `axe-core`, and `@types/cypress-axe`. Run the e2e tests and
fix the errors that show up.

Note: Installing `axe-core` directly will ensure you get the latest version.
As of October 2020, the `cypress-axe` library is behind on its dependency of `axe-core`.
